1. instructor is fixed for a department for a course                --- done :-)

2a.Give every meeting time an unique id                             --- done :-(

2.take number of classes of each course                             --- done :-)

3.implementing labs 
    three hours should be adjacent                                  --- done -_-

4.implement sub groups for labs

5. create UI                                              --Amrutha 

6. create database which would easy to implement all below queries     --Eswar
    A. able to add lectures , classrooms , studentGrps etc.
    B. retrieving all data 
        1. all classes for a particular studentGrp
        2. all classes for a lecturer
        3. all the free classrooms in a particular time


there are 5 important classes we need to know 

data class
driver class
schedule class
Algorithm class
population class


data class is where we take all data from database and will be stored in respective variables and classes

driver class is the main class which will be called from generate time table button

schedule class is where the schedule is designed each and every time  ,it also checks number of conflicts and calculates 
    the fitness factor

population class consists all the available possible solutions and sort by fitness method
 
Algorithm class this is where our algorithm runs
     4 important methods are crossOver population
                             crossOver schedule
                             mutate population
                             mutate schedule
